- 👋 Hi, I’m Jan. Cheers.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff. Python, data science etc. 
- 👴 Alltough pretty old allready, but feeling energetic enough to dream of being a pythonista and digital nomad.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github, advanced Python, software development basics. 
- 👨‍🎓 Be smart: learn all this when you're young. It's a huge difference. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: maybe some project in the future
- 🎁 new job, working with data etc. would be nice. (currently manager business intelligence)
- 📫 How to reach me: for starters >> direct message in github will do (if this is possible on gighub?).
